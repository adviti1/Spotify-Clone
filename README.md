# Spotify Clone

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that replicates the core features of Spotify. It allows users to sign up, log in, browse music, create playlists, and play songs. The front end is built using React.js, and the back end is powered by Node.js, Express.js, and a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL). Authentication is handled using OAuth2 (e.g., Spotify API) or JWT tokens.
